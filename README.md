# Information Visualisation project: The March of the Emperor
The goal of this project is to show the effect of global warming over time on the penguin populations of Antarctica. Using data from the [Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics](http://www.penguinmap.com/mapppd), we have created a visualisation of penguin populations observed between 1895 and 2018.
